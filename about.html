    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is thyyazan Al-Ghail. I am a passionate web developer and technology enthusiast
      who loves to build useful and creative websites. I have always been curious about how things
      work on the internet, and I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean code and simple design.
    </p>

    <p>When I am not coding, I love reading books about technology, self-development, and history.
      I also enjoy photography, exploring nature, and spending time with my friends and family.
      I believe that balance between work and life is the key to staying creative and motivated.
    </p>

    <p>My goal is to keep growing my skills every day, learn new programming languages, and
      contribute to projects that can make people’s lives easier. Through this website,
      I want to share my projects, my achievements, and the things I am passionate about.
      Thank you for visiting my personal website!
